Partial solution to Data Processors coding exercise

This is a depth-first solution to the DAG exploration part of the problem, written in C++. It doesn't address the socket stuff because that's fiddly and time-consuming to do in C/C++ (is there really no solution out there? Must look harder).

I have a feeling that a breadth-first solution might scale better.

Watch for a Ruby or Python solution, if only because there's probably a handy gem or module or something to do the socket stuff.

Of course to test all this I need to provide a server as well.
